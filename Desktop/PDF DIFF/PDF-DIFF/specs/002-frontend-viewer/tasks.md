# Tasks: PDF Comparison Frontend - Upload & Viewer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-frontend-viewer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack), spec.md (4 user stories), data-model.md (entities), contracts/api.ts (API contract), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (dev setup)

**Tests**: Test tasks are OPTIONAL and NOT included in this MVP scope. Implementation focuses on delivering user story functionality first.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (US1-US4) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend (this feature)**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`
- **Backend (separate)**: `backend/` (unchanged)
- **Specs**: `specs/002-frontend-viewer/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must complete in order)

1. **Phase 1** (Setup) ‚Üí Must complete before anything else
2. **Phase 2** (Foundational) ‚Üí Must complete before user stories
3. **Phase 3** (US1) ‚Üí MVP starts here, can parallel with Phase 4
4. **Phase 4** (US2) ‚Üí Can run parallel with Phase 3
5. **Phase 5** (US3) ‚Üí Depends on Phase 4 (needs ResultsPage)
6. **Phase 6** (US4) ‚Üí Depends on Phase 4 (needs results data)
7. **Phase 7** (Navigation) ‚Üí Depends on all story phases
8. **Phase 8** (Polish) ‚Üí Last phase, no dependencies

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Within Phase 1**:
- T004-T007 can run in parallel (all setup configuration)

**Within Phase 2**:
- T011, T012, T013 (types) can run in parallel
- T015, T016, T019 (services) can run in parallel
- T022, T023, T024 (hooks) can run in parallel

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T028-T031 (components) can run in parallel
- Then T032-T040 (component logic) can run in parallel after

**Within Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T041-T045 (components) can run in parallel
- Then T046-T055 (component logic) can run in parallel after

**Within Phase 8**:
- T077-T095 (all polish tasks) can run in parallel

## MVP Scope (Minimum to Ship)

**Essential for Users**:
‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup
‚úÖ Phase 2: Foundational
‚úÖ Phase 3: User Story 1 (Upload)
‚úÖ Phase 4: User Story 2 (View Results)

**Nice to have but not MVP**:
‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 5: User Story 3 (Page Navigation) - Can ship without
‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 6: User Story 4 (Export) - Can ship without
‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 7: Supporting Views - Can use simple 404
‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 8: Polish - Basic version acceptable

**Suggested first release**: Complete Phase 1-4 (~60 tasks, ~2 week sprint)

---

## Task Summary Statistics

- **Total Tasks**: 104
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 18 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: 15 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 7 (Navigation)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 28 tasks

**Parallelizable Tasks**: ~45 tasks (marked with [P])
**Sequential Tasks**: ~59 tasks (dependent on others)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Backend Assumption**: Backend API running at `http://localhost:8000` with endpoints:
   - `POST /api/v1/upload` (takes 2 PDFs, returns job_id)
   - `GET /api/v1/compare/{job_id}` (returns job status and results)

2. **Testing Strategy**: No unit/integration tests in MVP. Can add in Phase 2 enhancement:
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - Service tests with Vitest
   - E2E tests with Playwright

3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase produces a testable increment:
   - After Phase 2: Can start Phase 3 or 4 in parallel
   - After Phase 3: Users can upload files
   - After Phase 4: Users can view results
   - After Phase 5: Users can navigate multi-page PDFs
   - After Phase 6: Users can export reports

4. **Performance Targets** (from success criteria):
   - Page load < 2 seconds
   - PDF render < 1 second per page
   - Upload < 10 seconds for 50MB
   - Polling < 3 seconds between requests

5. **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

## Ready to Execute

All 104 tasks are organized, sequenced, and ready for implementation. Start with Phase 1 to initialize the project, then proceed through phases in order. Phases 3-4 can run in parallel for faster delivery.

Next step: `npm run dev` in frontend directory and begin with T001! üöÄ
