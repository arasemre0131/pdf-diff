# Specification Quality Checklist: PDF Comparison Frontend - Upload & Viewer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear User Stories**: 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) each independently testable and deployable
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 16 functional requirements covering upload, viewer, job management, and UI
3. **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**: All user stories have specific Given-When-Then scenarios
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: 7 distinct edge cases identified with expected behavior
5. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes with specific metrics (time, percentages, dimensions)
6. **Clear Assumptions**: 8 key assumptions documented to clarify design decisions
7. **No Ambiguity**: All requirements are testable and unambiguous

### Next Steps

✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate the implementation plan
