# Feature Specification: PDF Comparison Frontend - Upload & Viewer

**Feature Branch**: `002-frontend-viewer`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a frontend for the PDF comparison API with file upload and comparison result viewer components"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Upload Two PDF Files for Comparison (Priority: P1)

A user needs to select and upload two PDF files to initiate a comparison job. The system should handle file selection, validation, and transmission to the backend API.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the essential entry point for the entire feature. Without file upload, no comparison can occur. This is the core MVP functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the upload page, selecting two PDF files, and submitting them, which returns a job ID and transitions to the comparison status view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the upload page, **When** they select two valid PDF files and click upload, **Then** the system shows a loading indicator and submits the files to the API
2. **Given** files are uploaded successfully, **When** the API returns a job ID, **Then** the user is redirected to the comparison results page with the job ID in the URL
3. **Given** the upload is in progress, **When** the user clicks a cancel button, **Then** the upload is cancelled and the user returns to the upload page

---

### User Story 2 - View PDF Comparison Results (Priority: P1)

A user should be able to view the side-by-side comparison results of two PDFs, including highlighted differences such as text changes, additions, deletions, and moved content. The viewer should poll for job status until results are available.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the core value delivery of the feature. Users need to see the comparison results to benefit from the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to a comparison job URL, polling for results, and displaying the side-by-side viewer with difference highlighting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to a results page with a valid job ID, **When** the job is still processing, **Then** the system displays a "Processing..." message and polls the API every 3 seconds for updates
2. **Given** the comparison job completes, **When** results are available, **Then** the page displays both PDFs side-by-side with differences highlighted
3. **Given** results are displayed, **When** the user zooms in or scrolls, **Then** both pages synchronize their scroll position and zoom level

---

### User Story 3 - Navigate PDF Pages and View Difference Summary (Priority: P2)

A user should be able to navigate between pages in the comparison viewer and see a summary of differences found (e.g., "15 differences found", "3 pages with changes").

**Why this priority**: P2 - Enhances usability of multi-page PDFs. Users can jump between pages with differences and understand the scope of changes at a glance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a multi-page comparison result, navigating pages, and verifying the difference summary display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a multi-page PDF comparison is displayed, **When** the user clicks next/previous page buttons, **Then** the viewer shows the corresponding pages from both PDFs
2. **Given** results are displayed, **When** the user looks at the summary section, **Then** they see total number of differences and number of pages with changes
3. **Given** the user is on a page with no differences, **When** they click "next difference" button, **Then** the viewer jumps to the next page that contains differences

---

### User Story 4 - Export Comparison Report (Priority: P3)

A user should be able to download a summary report of the comparison results in PDF or document format.

**Why this priority**: P3 - Nice-to-have feature for users who need to share results or archive comparisons. Not essential for MVP but adds value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying the export button, clicking it, and downloading a report file successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a comparison result is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Export Report", **Then** a PDF report is generated and downloaded with the summary of differences

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user uploads files larger than 50MB? (System should show a clear error message with file size limit)
- How does the system handle unsupported file formats? (System should validate file type and show error before upload)
- What happens when the API request times out during polling? (System should retry up to 3 times, then show an error with option to reload)
- How does the system handle network disconnection during upload? (System should show "Network error - connection lost" with retry button; user must restart upload from beginning)
- What happens if the comparison takes longer than expected (e.g., > 10 minutes)? (System should notify user and allow them to save job ID for later retrieval)
- How does the system handle identical PDFs? (System should show 0 differences and display a clear message)
- What happens when user navigates to a non-existent job ID? (System should show a 404 message with option to start a new comparison)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

**Upload Functionality**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a file input UI that accepts drag-and-drop or file selection for PDF files
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that exactly two files are selected before allowing upload
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that selected files are PDF format and show clear error messages for invalid formats
- **FR-004**: System MUST display upload progress indicator showing percentage and file size during transmission
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent uploading files larger than 50MB with a clear error message

**Comparison Results Viewer**:
- **FR-006**: System MUST poll the comparison API status endpoint every 3 seconds while job is processing

- **FR-009**: System MUST display a summary of differences (total count and affected pages)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support PDF navigation (next/previous page, jump to specific page)

**Job Management**:
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve job ID in the URL to allow bookmarking and sharing results
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to access previously completed comparisons using the job ID (cached in browser memory during session, cleared on page close)
- **FR-013**: System MUST display clear error messages for failed comparison jobs with option to restart

**UI/UX**:
- **FR-014**: System MUST be responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-015**: System MUST show loading states, error states, and empty states clearly
- **FR-016**: System MUST persist file upload state temporarily to allow users to review selections before submitting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ComparisonJob**: Represents a PDF comparison job. Key attributes: job_id, status (pending/processing/completed/failed), created_at, result_url, error_message
- **UploadedFile**: Represents a user-selected PDF file. Attributes: file_name, file_size, file_type, upload_progress
- **ComparisonResult**: Represents the result of a completed comparison. Attributes: total_differences, pages_with_changes, difference_details (per-page breakdown), generated_at

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can upload two PDF files and receive a job ID within 10 seconds of clicking submit
- **SC-002**: System polls for results and displays comparison output within 3 seconds of job completion
- **SC-003**: 95% of users can successfully complete a PDF comparison and view results without encountering errors
- **SC-004**: Page load time for comparison results viewer is under 2 seconds on standard internet connection
- **SC-005**: Side-by-side PDF viewer maintains synchronized scrolling and zoom across both PDFs with no lag
- **SC-006**: System handles PDF files up to 50MB without performance degradation or timeouts
- **SC-007**: Error messages are clear and actionable, with success rate of user self-recovery being 80% or higher
- **SC-008**: Responsive layout works correctly on devices with screen widths from 320px (mobile) to 2560px (large desktop)

## Assumptions

- **Backend API Available**: The comparison API backend (`/api/v1/upload`, `/api/v1/compare/{job_id}`) is fully functional and returns results in the expected format
- **PDF Format Support**: Input PDFs are standard PDF files (not encrypted or password-protected)
- **File Size Limits**: 50MB is the reasonable file size limit for client-side processing and upload constraints
- **Processing Time**: Comparison jobs typically complete within 2-5 minutes under normal load
- **No Authentication**: MVP assumes no user authentication required (open access to upload/compare)
- **Modern Browser**: Users have modern browsers supporting ES6, CSS Grid, Fetch API, and File APIs
- **Polling Strategy**: Status polling every 3 seconds is acceptable; WebSocket would be future optimization
- **Difference Detection**: Backend handles difference detection; frontend only displays results in UI

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-29

- **Q: Should comparison results be cached locally for fast revisits?** → **A: Cache in browser memory (React state) during session only.** Results clear on page close. Matches MVP scope and provides good UX without persistent storage complexity.

- **Q: Should upload pause/resume be implemented for network disconnections?** → **A: No pause/resume. Show "Network error - retry" option only.** Simplifies uploadManager and avoids backend chunking complexity. Users can restart upload if needed.

- **Q: Should PDF viewer support touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom) for mobile?** → **A: Yes, support both mouse (scroll wheel, keyboard +/-) and touch (pinch-to-zoom).** Leverage pdfjs-dist built-in gesture support for MVP-friendly implementation.
